# Salary-Prediction-Based-on-Experience-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model
In this project, I built a simple linear model. This model predicts employees' salary based on their year of experience.

# Dataset Sources and Structure

source of the dataset
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle
Data Link
Dataset File Type: CSV

# What I Did

Data Collection: The dataset has been taken from Kaggle
Exploratory Analysis: Scatterplot and correlation analysis
Model Building: Salary Prediction Based on Experience – Simple Linear Regression Model
Model App Link: https://predict-salary-model.streamlit.app/
Model Evaluation: R², MAE, MSE
Deployment: Deploy this model as an app using Python (Streamlit)

# Key Insight 

The model I created will predict salary, if you give the model years of experience as input, the model will predict salary according to experience.
If the user gives the model 17 years of experience as input, the model will predict his salary 185,526.44.

# Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Streamlit)
