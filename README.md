# Salary-Prediction-Based-on-Experience-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model
In this project, I built a simple linear model. This model predicts employees' salary based on their year of experience.

# Dataset Sources and Structure

source of the dataset
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle
Data Link
Dataset File Type: CSV

# What I Did

Data Collection: The dataset has been taken from Kaggle
Exploratory Analysis: Scatterplot and correlation analysis
Model Building: Salary Prediction Based on Experience – Simple Linear Regression Model
Model App Link: https://predict-salary-model.streamlit.app/
Model Evaluation: R², MAE, MSE
Deployment: Deploy this model as an app using Python (Streamlit)

# Model Evaluation

For every 1 year of experience, salary increases by about 27,151 - Slop :  [27151.53742583]
With 0 years of experience, predicted salary starts at about 74,208 - Intercept:  74207.625 
The average difference between the actual value and the predicted value - MSE: 49830096.85590834
Mean square of the difference - MAE: 6286.453830757746
Square root of MSE - EMSE: 7059.043621901506 
Model Performance Score:  0.9024461774180498

# Key Insight 

The model I created will predict salary, if you give the model years of experience as input, the model will predict salary according to experience.
If the user gives the model 17 years of experience as input, the model will predict his salary 185,526.44.
